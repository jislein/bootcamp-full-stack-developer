# JavaScript: Classes and Objects

## Assignment

We were assigned to create a `class Person` with an interest list.
## Goals:

Create and use a `class Person` to manage and show information about personal interests and other details, creating an `Array` property adding the interest to it.

1. Define a `class Person`:
	-  Properties: `name`, `age`, `interests` (a string array that includes the person's interests.
	-  Methods:
		1. Constructor: Initialize the `name`, `age` (optional), and can start with some `interests`.
		2. `addInterest(interest)`: Add a new interest to the array of interests.
		3. `removeInterest(interest)`: Removes an interest from the array if it exist.
		4. `showInterest()`: Prints all the interests of a person, properly formatted.
		5. `showInfo()`: Prints all the info of the person, including age and interests.
2. Create Objects of the class Person:
	- Instantiate various Person objects, adding and removing interests to demonstrate the complete functionality of the class.
