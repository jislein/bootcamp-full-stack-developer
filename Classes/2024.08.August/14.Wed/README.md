# JavaScript: Array, Loops and Operators


## Assignment

We where assigned a Code Kata of creating a program that process students grades and do multiple operations with them.

### Goals:

1. [ ]  **Create and array** with the grades of 10 students. Grades must be integer numbers between 0 and 100.
2. **Simulate grade management** using `push()`, `pop()`, `shift()` and `unshift()` (Optional):
	1. [ ] **Allow adding a new grade** at the end of the array using `push()`
	2. [ ] **Allow deleting the last grade** using `pop()`
	3. [ ] **Allow adding a new grade** ant the beginning of the aray using `unshift()`
	4. [ ] **Allow deleting the grade of the first student** using `shift()`
3. **Loop the array** using a `for` loop to do the following tasks:
	1. [ ] Print (show in console, alert, etc) each grade.
	2. [ ] Count how many students passed (**grades >= 60**) and how many didn't pass.
4. [ ] **Calculate the average** of all grades.
5. **Compare each grade** with the average using comparison operators:
	1. [ ] If the grade is equal or greater than the average, print "**Grade above average**".
	2. [ ] If the grade is lower than the average, print "**Grade below average**".
6. [ ] **Sort the array** of grades in ascendant and descendant order using the `sort()` method (**Optional**).
