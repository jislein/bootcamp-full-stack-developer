# Introduction to JavaScript: Data Types and Variables


## Assignment

We where assigned a Code Kata of creating a Temperature Converter between Celsius, Fahrenheit and Kelvin.

### Goals:

#### 1. Initial Configuration:
* [x]  Create a JavaScript file in your preferred development environment.

#### 2. Variable Declaration:
* [x] Use `const` to declare initial temperatures in a specified  scale. For example, `const celcius = 25;`. Identify "universal constants".
* [x] Use `let` for the variables that will store the converted values.

#### 3. Conversion Implementation:
* [x] Celsius to Fahrenheit
* [x] Celsius to Kelvin
* [x] Fahrenheit to Celsius
* [x] Fahrenheit to Kelvin
* [x] Kelvin to Celsius
* [x] Kelvin to Fahrenheit

#### 4. User Input (Optional but recommended):
* [x] To make the program more interactive, request the user the temperature value and initial scale.

#### 5. Result Output:
* [x] Use `console.log()` to show the conversion results in the console.

#### 6. Data Validation (Optional):
* [x] Consider implementing independent validations to verify compliance.

#### 7. Comments and Readability:
* [x] Add comments to your code to explain each section and facilitate its comprehension.
* [x] Appropriately use the corresponding naming or nomenclatures of variables.
